- Please fill out this template with all the relevant information so we can
  understand what's going on and fix the issue.

- `@testing-library/reblend` version:
- Testing Framework and version:
  <!-- are you using jest, mocha, puppeteer, ava? And what version? -->
- DOM Environment:
  <!-- If you're using jsdom (the default with jest), what version? Otherwise, what browser and version are you running tests in? -->

<!--
Keep in mind that if you're using a version of node we don't support that
could also be an issue. Check our package.json file "engines" config for the
supported version.

Also keep in mind that if you're using a version of reblend we don't support
that could be an issue. Check our package.json file "peerDependencies" config
for the supported version.
